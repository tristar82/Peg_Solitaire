## Assignment Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a functioning game of Peg Solitaire. The game needed to meet the following requirements:
* allows a user to play the game of peg solitaire via a basic interface;
* allows only the legal moves from peg solitaire;
* allows a user to input moves step by step by loading a solution file that contains a chain of moves; and
* logs the users moves and outputs the log to file.

## Additional Libraries Used
The Rich Table library was used for enhanced display of the board and character map positions. More details can be found within the [documentation](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html).
